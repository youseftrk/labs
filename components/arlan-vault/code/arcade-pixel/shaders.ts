// Arcade pixel type — the shader.
//
// The geometry is already decided by the time we get here: the mask carries the

// quantised on the same low-res grid (see text-mask.ts). This pass paints them,
// then puts the poster's surface on top.
//
// WHAT THE SOURCE PSD ACTUALLY CONTAINS, since two earlier builds got this wrong
// by reading the layer names instead of the pixels:
//
//   Background            solid #EB0809
//   Effect/Layer          the word, as a smart object that is ALREADY PIXELATED
//                         (a 150x39 bitmap scaled 25x, measured), carrying two
//                         outside strokes: 73px white, then 103px #1F1E1C
//   Effect/Threshold 150  in COLOR BURN — crushes the leftover antialiasing,
//                         it is NOT what makes the blocks
//   Textures/             two gradients, Noise (hard light 30%), Dust (screen
//                         20%), Noise (linear light 70%)
//
// THE TEXTURES ARE REAL IMAGES, NOT PROCEDURAL NOISE, and this is worth stating
// because generating them was the obvious shortcut and it looks nothing like the
// source. Pulling the actual layer pixels out of the PSD:
//   - the "Noise" on HARD LIGHT is a MOIRE INTERFERENCE PATTERN — two curved
//     line gratings beating against each other (measured: ~28.5px at ~28deg and
//     ~41px at ~4deg, and the angle swings across the frame, so the gratings are
//     genuinely curved rather than straight). It is the thing that gives the
//     flat ground its woven, screen-printed shimmer.
//   - the "Noise" on LINEAR LIGHT is fine per-pixel monochrome grain.
//   - "Dust" on SCREEN is sparse bright specks (mean 9/255).
// The moire in particular cannot be faked with a hash: it is structured, and a
// random field in its place reads as television static, which is exactly how the
// first build looked.
//   Settings/             Vibrance +20, Levels in 5..230 gamma 1.00
//
// The two things worth keeping in mind: the ground SURVIVES (the threshold sits
// on a smart object only as big as the word, so there is nothing to burn out on
// the open poster — burning the whole frame drives every pixel to black), and
// the blocks come from RESOLUTION, never from thresholding a blur.
