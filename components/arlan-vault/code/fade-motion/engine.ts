// Fade motion — WebGL1.
//
// A word that trails downward into light. Nothing is blurred and no gradient is
// painted: the trail is pure ACCUMULATION. Coverage after k overlapping copies of
// the word at alpha a is
//
//     1 - (1-a)^k
//
// which is why the falloff is fast at first and then a long tail. That law is the
// effect.
//
// The accumulation is evaluated per-pixel in a fragment shader: the fragment
// marches UP the trail and asks how many copies would have covered it. One draw
// call, cost independent of the copy count — so the frame time does not spike at
// the exact moment the cursor moves, which is when the dt-scaled followers most
// need short, even frames to track rather than lurch.
//
// On a dark preset it is LIGHT on a dark ground — the trail is the word's own glow
// smeared, so the stack ADDS. On a light preset the same accumulation runs
// SUBTRACTIVELY, as ink density on paper, because adding light to white blows out
// and leaves nothing to see. Either way it reads as one long exposure rather than
// a stack of shadows.
//
// The pointer FOLLOWS. The word turns to face the cursor and the trail reels in as
// you approach; it does not get shoved around, and a small move produces a small
// turn rather than a smear in the opposite direction.
