// The Canvas 2D version stamped the word ~210 times and let the copies overlap.
// This does the SAME accumulation, but per-pixel and backwards: for each fragment
// we march UP the trail direction, asking "how many copies of the word would have
// covered me?", and combine them with the identical coverage law
//
//     coverage after k overlapping stamps at alpha a  =  1 - (1-a)^k
//
// Marching backward from the pixel is what makes it one draw call instead of 210:
// the CPU version had to touch every pixel of every copy (~400 blits a frame once
// the chromatic pass kicked in, which is what made moving the cursor — the exact
// moment the pass turned on — the slowest thing the card ever did). Here the cost
// is fixed and independent of the copy count.
//
// Depth is a real perspective divide, same as before: a copy `z` behind the plane
// is scaled by focal/(focal+z) about the anchor. We invert that per step, so the
// trail still tapers and converges toward the vanishing point rather than shearing.
