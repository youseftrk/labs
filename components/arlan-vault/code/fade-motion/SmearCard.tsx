// The Vault card + detail hero: a word trailing downward into light.
//
// Nothing is blurred. The word is stamped a couple of hundred times, each copy a
// step further down and each one barely visible, so where many copies overlap it
// reads solid and where few overlap it fades out. Drawn as light on a dark ground
// so the copies ADD — it reads as a long exposure, not a stack of shadows.
//
// Standard live-card lifecycle: built one frame after it nears view, paused
// offscreen / tab-hidden / during a cross-route morph, one still frame under
// reduced motion.
