// Holo — the maths and the materials behind an identity card that catches the
// light.
//
// Four ideas carry the whole thing.
//
//   ONE INPUT SHAPE. Pointer and device orientation are completely different
//   signals, so both are normalised to the same { x, y } in -1..1 before
//   anything reads them. Everything downstream — tilt, foil position, glare,
//   sheen — derives from that one pair, which is why swapping input sources
//   needs no other change.
//
//   THE FOIL LAGS THE CARD. Real laminate has mass: the surface catches up to
//   the card rather than moving with it. Two followers at different stiffnesses
//   is what turns a gradient that tracks a cursor into a material.
//
//   THE PRINT NEVER CHANGES. The card is pink, and it stays pink under every
//   material. Only the foil above it changes. A preset that re-prints the card
//   is a different card; a preset that changes the foil is the same card under
//   a different laminate, which is the thing being demonstrated.
//
//   MATERIALS ARE DATA, NOT CSS. Every material is three generic layers whose
//   entire paint — image, scale, position rate, blend, filter, opacity curve —
//   comes from custom properties. The stylesheet never knows which material is
//   mounted, so adding a material is adding an object to the array below.
